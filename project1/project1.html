    <h2>Describe how search engines work:</h2>
    <h3>How search engines work is by taking input from a user, before searching their massive database to find results relevant to the search. Once the search engine finds this set of data, it then sorts these results on both relevancy and popularity, before returning the list of results to the user.</h3>
    <h2>Explain the importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags:</h2>
    <h3>The importance of keywords and descriptions as meta tags is so that search engines can effectively sort your page such that it can show the site to the appropriate audience. As well, by having these keywords and descriptions, it allows your site to be more likely to be shown by it's intended audience, as the search engine will be more likely to show the page to these users.</h3>
    <h2>List the four elements that comprise writing relevant content links:</h2>
    	<h3>The four elements that compromise a relevant content link is the opening tag, which is a, before having the link referral tag included in that opening tag, which is where clicking on the link will take the user, in the form of a url, before closing the opening tag and writing a description of what the link is, commonly referred to as an anchor of text. Lastly, we close out the link, thus making the content link complete.</h3>
    <h2>What constitutes good heading hierarchy and include an example with more than one heading tag:</h2>
    <h3>The things that constitute good heading hierarchy generally boils down to just one major thing: levels of importance. The lower the number of the heading is (closer to h1), the more important the information is seen to be by both the user and the search engine. As an example, we would probably want the title of our page to be in an h1 tag, and any major sections with h2 tags, so that the major elements of the content are seen and split accordingly.</h3>
