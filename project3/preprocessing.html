	<!-- When it came to doing preprocessing, I used the NodeJS software, which lets me compile my LESS file into a CSS file using a command prompt command. As this was my first time using LESS, I wanted to be very safe and simple with the elements of preprocessing I used.
	Thus, I kept my use of it to two major elements, variables and operators to create the main elements of the button gradient and drop shadow, and I would do the rest in CSS
	My LESS file, which only is part of the overall CSS:
	@length: 5px;
	@color1: Aqua;
	@color2: Aquamarine;
	@color3: DarkGray;
	button {
		background: @color1;
		background: linear-gradient(90deg, @color1 0%, @color2 100%);
		filter: drop-shadow(@length * 2, @length);
	}
	body {
		background: @color3;
		float: center;
	}-->

	<h2>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing:</h2>
    	<h3>The main ways to implement preprocessing are to either use a web server to compile the files into CSS, and the other way is to compile it within your own development environment which then allows you to have the CSS files. Both of these methods are very similar in what results.</h3>
    <h2>Define and describe the mechanisms used in LESS:</h2>
    	<h3>Mixins: Similar to functions, these allow us to use properties from one class for another class, usually declared very similar to a JavaScript function within the file; Variables: A way to easily use values in various locations across multiple pages; Functions: Functions allow us to manipulate various values within the HTML, such as an element's width; Operators: These are commonly math related that allow us to use variables with modifications for additional creativity; Nested Variables: Nested variables allow us to specifically make changes to a variable to just a specific part of the webpage, such as just the footer of a page;</h3>
