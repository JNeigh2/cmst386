	<h2>Explain the ways to implement preprocessing:</h2>
    	<h3>The main ways to implement preprocessing are to either use a web server to compile the files into CSS, and the other way is to compile it within your own development environment which then allows you to have the CSS files. Both of these methods are very similar in what results.</h3>
    <h2>Define and describe the mechanisms used in LESS:</h2>
    	<h3>Mixins: Similar to functions, these allow us to use properties from one class for another class, usually declared very similar to a JavaScript function within the file; Variables: A way to easily use values in various locations across multiple pages; Functions: Functions allow us to manipulate various values within the HTML, such as an element's width; Operators: These are commonly math related that allow us to use variables with modifications for additional creativity; Nested Variables: Nested variables allow us to specifically make changes to a variable to just a specific part of the webpage, such as just the footer of a page;</h3>
