	<h2>What is the importance of responsive design and it's impact on the target audience?</h2>
    	<h3>The importance of responsive design is to ensure that no matter what size screen someone is accessing your content from, they get a great experience. Most often, you see this as developing for both desktop and mobile sized screens, which allows your target audience to use your website no matter what platform they are on. This allows us to both create and keep a wider user base.</h3>
    <h2>Describe 3 different kinds of reports that Google Analytics give that tells you what your target audience is accessing:</h2>
    	<h3>The first report I would like to talk about is the events report, which tells me about the different actions that a user takes when they are on the site. I also think the Pages and Screens Report is very useful, as it shows which pages are being accessed the most, which helps us see more insight into what our target audience wants out of the website. The final report I think is useful is the User Acquisition report, which shows me how my audience is reaching my page, which allows for me to better market the website to reach my target audience better.</h3>
